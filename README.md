This is submitted as Generation FSD Bootcamp Assessment.

●  	What did you like about this project?
It was a fun exercises and I learn a lot when trying to code the application for the assessment.

●  	What did you struggle with in this project?
It was difficult to move from front end to backend as we need to port over the codes, 
change the codes so that it will work on backend and retest it again for errors. The whole proccess was a bit clumbersome.

●  	What would make your experience with this assessment better?
If there was an integrated IDE that can be use to code the front end and also work on the backend, it will have been easier.
